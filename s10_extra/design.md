"Machine learning engineering is 10% machine learning and 90% engineering." - *Chip Huyen*

We highly recommend that you read the book
*Designing Machine Learning Systems: An Iterative Process for Production-Ready Applications* by Chip Huyen which gives
an fantastic overview of the thought processes that goes into designing moder machine learning systems.

# The stack

Have you ever encountered the concept of **full stack developer**. A full stack developer is an developer who can
both develop client and server software or in more general terms, it is a developer who can take care of the complete
developer pipeline.

Below is seen an image of the massive amounts of tools that exist within the MLOps umbrella.

In this course we have chosen to make our own canvas, but it is highly inspired by
[Machine Learning Canvas](https://madewithml.com/static/templates/ml-canvas.pdf) from the
[Made with ML course](https://madewithml.com/) and the
[Machine Learning Canvas](https://www.ownml.co/machine-learning-canvas) by Louis Dorard.

!!! note "Editing the canvas"

    The canvas is made in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), which I use for all my diagrams. You can easily begin
    editing the canvas by clicking
    [here](https://app.diagrams.net/?client=1#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FSkafteNicki%2Fdtu_mlops%2Fdesign%2Ffigures%2Fdiagrams%2Fmlops_canvas.drawio#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22pnmmrmMmQEoPrk8f0Ppy%22%7D) which will open the web version of draw.io with the canvas loaded.
